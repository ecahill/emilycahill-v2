My name is Emily Cahill, I graduated from Georgia Institute of 
Technology with a Computer Science degree in 
December 2015. During my time in school, I completed 
three internships as well as the College of Computing study abroad 
program in Barcelona, Spain. 

## Currently

After graduating, I moved to Austin, Texas to work full time
as a Front End Engineer at Bazaarvoice. My team, known as the Display Team, is responsible for the front end of BV's main product, Conversations (Ratings and Reviews), as well as additional, smaller third party apps that we are currently experimenting with. These applications are products that clients can implement along with Conversations to have better SEO, get more reviews from their customers, and help their customers make smarter purchasing decisions by seeing more specific review content. One of the applications that I helped develop is called Seller Ratings Display. It is a third
party Javascript application that shows a retailer's Google Seller Ratings on their home page. 

Since I started working at Bazaarvoice,
I have advanced my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills, as well as gained
experience in Node.js, React, and Redux. I have learned about how we help our clients increase their SEO and how to overcome the challenges of developing third party Javascript applications. 

## Past Work Experience

My first internship, during summer of 2012, was with 
Diaz Foods Wholesale in Atlanta, GA as an IT assistant. During 
this internship, my primary responsibilities were managing 
and installing software, maintaining hardware for desktop systems, and 
providing general assistance to the IT manager. 
My second 
internship was during the summer of 2013 with Phillips 66 in 
Bartlesville, Oklahoma, where I worked on the Web Application 
Services team. My project for the summer was to build a web 
application to store information on crude oil samples. This project 
gave me a better understanding of the application development 
process and web development concepts. I developed the project 
using the .NET Framework in Visual Studio with ASP.NET as the 
front-end development environment and C# as the code behind. 
The application used a SQL Server back-end database.
My most recent internship was with Amazon.com in Seattle, WA where I was a part of the EC2 Spot Instances team of Amazon Web Services. My project was to design, develop, and test a new API that allowed users of the Spot Fleet service to change specific configuration values of Spot Fleet requests that they have placed. This API is now available, and allows Spot Fleet users to modify the target capacity of their Spot Fleet requests. The API is called ModifySpotFleetRequest and the documentation can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifySpotFleetRequest.html). 

## Mobile Development Skills

I also have experience with Android development, having
made an Android app that tracks financial transactions. This app 
uses a SQLite database. As an awarded contestant in the 2013 
ConocoPhillips Innovation Challenge, I developed a Google 
Glass application. The application was intended for use by a field 
technician, allowing them to locate pumpjacks in their area, select 
one, and see data and graphs associated with that pumpjack, all 
hands-free. My team placed third in the competition out of four
teams.

## Extracurricular Involvements

In addition to classwork, I was a member of a sorority, 
President of the Equestrian Team, and a mentor of the College of 
Computing. I assisted with a research project funded by the 
National Science Foundation and Expanding Computing Education 
Pathways (ECEP). The project, called [Sisters Rise Up](http://www.ecepalliance.org/sisters-rise), aimed to 
increase the number of women in the Computer Science field. My 
responsibility was to organize and lead webinars and workshops for 
girls in local high school AP Computer Science classes to expose
them to and provide an in-depth understanding of Object Oriented 
Programming concepts. I also created video tutorials of educational 
programming tools such as [Scratch](scratch.mit.edu) and [MIT 
App Inventor] (http://appinventor.mit.edu) to show children that creating 
games or mobile apps can be fun and creative. The videos can be 
found at the Georgia Tech Institute for Computing Educationâ€™s
[Distance Learning site](http://ice.cc.gatech.edu/dl/).
